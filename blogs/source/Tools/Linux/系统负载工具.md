系统负载查看工具

---

> - 注：`系统平均负载是指在特定时间间隔内运行队列中的平均进程数。`
> - 注：如果每个CPU内核的当前活动进程数不大于3，那么系统的性能是良好的。如果每个CPU内核的任务数大于5，那么这台机器的性能有严重问题。如果是1个双核CPU linux 机器，当Load Average 为6时，说明机器CPU已经被充分使用了。

   ```shell
   # top
   # Display dynamic real-time information about running processes.
   # More information: <https://manned.org/top>.
   
   # Start top:
   top
   
   # Do not show any idle or zombie processes:
   top -i
   
   # Show only processes owned by given user:
   top -u username
   
   # Sort processes by a field:
   top -o field_name
   
   # Show the individual threads of a given process:
   top -Hp process_id
   
   # Show only the processes with the given PID(s), passed as a comma-separated list. (Normally you wouldn't know PIDs off hand. This example picks the PIDs from the process name):
   top -p $(pgrep -d ',' process_name)

   # Print current time, uptime, number of logged-in users and other information:

   14:05:11        up              6:05,           1 user,                              load average: 0.46, 0.54, 0.55
   ```

   - current time 当前服务器时间

   - system state 系统状态

   - running time 当前服务器运行时长

   - number of current logged in users 当前用户数

   - system load averages 当前的负载均值，load average: 0.46, 0.54, 0.55 分别取 1min, 5min, 15min 的均值

     

   ```shell
   # Filter the result to only show running time
   uptime -p
   
   # Filter the result to only show the date/time from when the system has been running
   uptime -s
   
   # Show the version of uptime
   uptime -V
   
   # Show the help page
